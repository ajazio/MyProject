Git

Git is a 
  - Source code Management Tool, and
  - Distributed version control Tool

Developed by Linus torvalds
used by 80% of developers


Distributed version control Tool
  Git is a distributed version control tool (as opposed to centralized). Meaning that you store the code locally 
  on your system as well as sync it to the git site which can then be accessible to others


- Download Git to your desktop
- Create a account on github
- synchronize the two. You are all set with the basic setup.


Git comes in both CLi and GUI, plus many third party also provide GUI tools.
The git CLi is called git-bash.
The git GUI is called GIT GUI



to check git version
 > git --version


After Git has been installed, you need to add a global setting via the CLi
These global settings specify which user is using git and his/her email id which will be used for collaboration purpose
You are basically setting the username and email id.

 > git config --global user.name myname
 > git config --global user.email myemail

To check the global variables
 > git config --list
   type q to exit the list



You can create aliases
git config --global alias.c clear
git config --global alias.got gitv



To see if a folder is part of git repository

via CLi go to the folder (using cd command)
 > git status

initially for the fist time it will not be part of the repository.
to make it part of the repository
 > git init

this will make that folder part of the repository
now if you type the got status command it will show that it is part of the repository


When you make a folder part of the repository the system will create a hidden folder in that folder which contains the details of version control synchronization database. since it is a hidden you can see it with
this command
 > ls -a
   ./  ../  .git/


The git init command converts a regular folder into repository. What if we want to convert this repository back to the regular folder. To do that just delete that hidden file.
 > rm -rf .git



Github
  is a centralized repository hub owned by Microsoft
  Other companies also have equivalent repositories

Competitors to Git   : Mercurial, Subversion
Competitors to GitHub: GitLab, Bitbucket, SourceForge, AWS CodeCommit, Azure Repos



--------- How git works at the architectural level


                   git add                   git commit                        git push
Working directory -----------> Staging area -------------> local repository  ------------> remote repository

Does the git diff file1 command show the 
  difference between the file in working directory and staging area or
  difference between the file in working directory and local repository or
  difference between the file in staging area and local repository

Working Directory
  Whatever files you create on your local laptop resides in your working directory
  These files are untracked. Untracked means that they are not setup for version control 


In order to track the file we need to move that file to the staging area
 The command to move the file to staging area is 
  > git add file1.txt

This moves the file to the staging area and from here on it is trackable

When executing the git add command you may get the following error
warning: in the working copy of 'file1', LF will be replaced by CRLF the next time Git touches it

You can ignore it, this refers to how the system is handling end of line characters.

LF (Line Feed): This is the newline character used in Unix and Unix-like systems (Linux, macOS).
CRLF (Carriage Return + Line Feed): This is the newline character sequence used in Windows systems.

The warning means that Git has detected that the file you are adding (file1) currently has Unix-style line endings (LF). However, according to your Git configuration, the file will be converted to Windows-style line endings (CRLF) the next time Git processes the file (e.g., when you check out the file).

This is handled by global settings core.autocrlf = true
  > git config --list 



  verify using the status command
  > git status
  

If there are multiple files in your directory and you want to track all of them then
> git add *


To remove this file from the staging area back to working directory
  > git rm --cached file1.txt



----------Commit


To move the file from staging area to the local repository we use the git commit command
  > git commit -m "any message" file1.txt

QQQQQ -- is the filename optional or required
Ans   -- The filename is optional

The commit command initiates the first snapshot and it is from this point on that the tracking has begun.

Each commit creates a unique commit hash like for example "commit 8c04ea9afc1df71dd2b5ae80387845d0f5aa07f6"
If a file is modified 10 times and comitted 10 times then each commit will have a unique commit hash. If you want to 
go back to the 5th version of the file you can do that by using the commit hash of the 5th version

  > git show 8c04ea9afc1df71dd2b5ae80387845d0f5aa07f6:file1

You dont need to specify the whole string, just the first 4 digits is enough (as long as they are unique)


QQQQQ -- is the -m flag optional or required.
Ans   -- -m flag is optional

To see the details of commit use the following command
  > git log



From here on any changes you make to the file, stays in working directory, you will the whole process again ie
move to staging area and then move to local repository.

----------

git diff command



                   git add                   git commit                        git push
Working directory -----------> Staging area -------------> local repository  ------------> remote repository



Lets say you made a change to file1 and the file is still in staging area (ie you have not issued the git add command), then you can
see differences between the file in working directory and the one in the staging area
  > git diff file1


git diff file1   ------------>   Shows the changes between the working directory and the staging area

git diff --staged or git diff --cached   ------------>   Shows the changes between the staging area and the local repository

git diff HEAD   ------------>   Shows the changes between the working directory and the local repository




You can also check the diff between 2 commits
  > git diff 1234 5678 
 where 1234 and 5678 are the commit hashes

The order of hashes matter, for ex
  > git diff a b
  > git diff b a

will show different results



----------------
git restore command

  > git restore file1

The git restore file1 command restores the file in the working directory to match the version in the staging area. This means that
any changes you made to file1 in the working directory will be discarded and replaced with the version of file1 that is currently staged.




Restore a file in the staging area to match the last commit (HEAD)
  > git restore --staged file1
This removes file1 from the staging area, effectively un-staging it. The working directory is not affected.
Then you issue this command
  > git restore file1
you will need to issue both these commands



Restore a file in both the working directory and staging area to match the last commit (HEAD):
  > git restore --source=HEAD --staged --worktree file1
This resets both the staging area and working directory versions of file1 to the version in the last commit. All changes to file1 since the last commit are lost.



---------

git show command


to see the content of the file1 in the working directory
  > vi file1


to see the content of file1 in staged area
  > git show :file1


to see the content of file1 in local repo
  > git show 1234:file1   where 1234 is the first 4 digits of the last commit hash

Pushing from Windows machine

                   git add                   git commit                        git push
Working directory -----------> Staging area -------------> local repository  ------------> remote repository


Before we push to the remote repository we need to create a remote repository on github.

once created, now we need to connect the local repository with the remote repository.

so on the local machine issue the following command
  > git remote add origin httplink

   Where origin refers to the name you want to assign to the remote repository (you can use any name, usually people assign the name "origin") and
   httplink is the http link to the remote repository


How to get the httplink
Go to github, click Code (dark green color button) and you will see the link there



Now to transfer the file from local repo to remote repo
  > git push -u origin master
 You will be prompted for github usename and password for security purpose
 The master here refers to the branch

QQQQQQ Why didnt we give the filename when pushing.


Pushing from linux machine

The process is the same as windows machine except that when it comes to giving username and password.
On linux it will not accept password. You will need to go to the github and generate a token and use this token when prompted for password.

Goto github, settings, developer settings, personal access tokens, tokens classic (you can choose the fine-grained one also), generate new token

type anything for Note
in select scope check repos
select expiration period
Generate token

Once you leave the window the token will no longer be visible so copy the token and save it locally in a safe place


-------------


Cloning

Cloning allows you to do the following
   Clone a public repo. ie copy the public repo to your local machine
   Clone a local repo from machine 1 to machine 2 (via github)
     Steps - save the repo to github and from there clone it to machine 2

> git clone http_link


Another option to copy someone's public repository is to use fork.
By forking you can copy someone's public repository in your github account. This assumes that the appropriate permissions have already been assigned)


--------

Push and Pull

Push - from local repo to remote repo
Pull - from remote repo to local repo



QQQQQ If I have to make changes to a file in the remote repo, can I make the change directly on the remote repo or do I have to first pull to my 
      local repo and then make changes and then push it to the remote repo.

Exam questions


Q
In the following git command 
 > git restore file1

which of the following options is correct

A file in staging area is restored back to the one in working directory
B file in local repository is restored back to the one in working directory
C file in local repository is restored back to the one in staged area
D file in staging area is restored back to the one in Remote repository

Ans: A








What is the difference between scripting vs configuration management
Ans - Scripting is a procedural approach, you will need to specify all the exact steps
      configuration management (CM) is a declarative approach. You just have to specify what has to be done and not deal
      with the specifics of exactly how it is done.
